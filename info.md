The **HairEyeColor Relation App** was developed for Developing Data
Products Course.

The app is intended to perform interactive data analysis showing the
distribution of hair and eye color aggregated by sex in 592 students at
the University of Delaware. The user can play around with the features
and see how much the graphs differ from each other. Additionally, one
can filter and download the data according to the variables used.

The variables and their levels are as follows:

<table>
<thead>

### Why using rCharts?

Since interactive visualization has become so fancy for data people,
**rCharts** offers one of the ways to do so. It is an R package to
create, customize and publish interactive javascript visualizations from
R using a familiar lattice style plotting interface. For more
